Py is a high level object oriented programming language. It is interactive and interpreted. -> HLL TO LLL line by line
Py is a multi paradigm programming language,supporting POP and OOP model.
Py has 2 different modes -> interactive and scripting.
Py Syntax. -> keywords, identifiers,line&idendation,multiline statements,quotations,comments.
A uniformly idendation bloc start from :
Py identifiers are used to identify function,variable,class,module. Class name starts w uppercase letters. Py is case sensitive.
Identifier with a single leading  underscore->private indentifier _abc
Identifier with 2leading underscore-> super private identifier __abc
Identifier also ending w 2 trailing underscores-> language defined special name also known as magic methods->__abc__ (used to overload the plus operator)
'', "", ''' ''' ->all are the sam string literals
Py allows the use of continuation character (\) to denote that line should continue.
Statements contained within [],{},() donot need the use of continuation character.
Data types -> Numbers, Strings, List [], Tuple (), Dictionary{}
Py Numbers(immutable data types) -> int(signed nos.), float(floating point real values), complex number(x+iy). All integers are represented by long int. 
There isnt any separate data type for long.
Mathematical Functions-> abs(+ve value of x),ceil,cmp(x,y) if(x<y)reutrn -1,if(x==y)return 0,if(x>y)return 1, exp(x) is exponential of x,fabs(x) is absolute value of x
floor, log,max,min,mod,pow,round,sqrt
The 2 mathematical constants->pi,e
Types of Operators->Arithmetic,Bitwise, Logical,Comparison,Assignment,Membership,Identity
